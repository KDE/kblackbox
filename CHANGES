	* Code optimisation and clean-up.

2007-02-10 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* GUI: New GraphicsView item: laser ray. Now the player can see laser rays on the board to check if he placed the balls correctly on the board and to understand better how the interactions in the black box do work. At the end of the game, he can also see the laser rays of the solution.
	* Separation of the class KBBBoard in 2 with the creation of the class KBBBallsOnBoard. The 1st one manages the game, the second one the boards.
	* Interaction result "HIT" is now diplayed on the board like every other interaction result.
	* Introduced contants to better manage the superposition order of the different graphic elements of the widget.
	* And some clean-up...

2007-02-09 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* Right mouse button can now be used to place markers on the black box: position "unsure" and marker "nothing".
	* The opposite border position of a laser ray is now highlighted, when the mouse is moving over one of the border position.
	* Menu item (and action) "resize" removed. (It was unnecessary).

2007-02-08 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* Code clean-up to solve the issues found by the English Breakfast Network (on  http://www.englishbreakfastnetwork.org/krazy/reports/kde-4.0/kdegames/kblackbox/ ).

2007-02-07 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* More SVG: The black box disposes now of a question mark. Lasers intend to try to look like lasers.

2007-02-03 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* Changed the way preferences are managed. It's not anymore with KSharedConfigPtr but with "KConfig XT". Good consequence: the following crash by closing the application disappeared: "Fatal Error: Accessed global static 'KGlobalPrivate *globalData()' after destruction." :)
	* Substituted the macro "RESTORE" by the template "kRestoreMainWindows" for session management in "main.cpp".

2007-02-03 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* New: Grid over the black box in the widget KBBScalableGraphicWidget.
	* Updates the KBBScalableGraphicWidget after starting a new game. (Small bug corrected)
	* Doesn't resize the widget automatically anymore after a change of the board size. It just bothered the player.

2007-02-02 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* GUI: Removed the "Give up" and "Done" actions in the menu and toolbar and used the standard game action "Solve" instead of both. Depending on how many balls the player placed on the board, the game will be normaly finished or given up (after confirmation).

2007-01-31 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* Full rewrite of the central graphic widget with QGraphicsView to improve the user experience and to provide cool effects in the future ,)
	* Full scalable central graphic widget (with some SVG elements: the balls and the cross): KBBScalableGraphicWidget.
	* Old central widget KBBGraphic is still there and can be activated by changing 2 lines in the code.
	* Set the version number to "0.4.0-SVN" as the changes are now big and visible.
	* Bug correction: Number of placed balls is now immediately updated.
	* Small temporary regressions: It's not possible to play with the keyboard anymore. User documentation is now out-dated.

2007-01-21 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* In KBBGraphic: Fusion of the methodes "setSize" and "clear" in a new one "newGame". (Code optimisation)

2007-01-20 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* Big clean-up (2nd part) to have a clean API between the logical game and the graphic widget (to be able to substitute it with a new one in the future).
	* User input is now managed by the graphic widget.
	* Full rewrite of the methode that calculates the trajectory of the laser ray.
	* Object "gameBoard" removed.
	* Documentation of the code of the class KBBBoard.

2007-01-18 Nicolas Roffet <nicolas-kde@roffet.com>
	* New private methode "KBBGame::comfirmGameEndIfNeeded()" to avoid duplication of code.
	* New member variable "m_gameReallyStarted" to avoid to annoy the user with the confirmation of the end of the game when the player didn't really start to play.
	* Removed several redundant tests "if (running)".
	* small clean up in "KBBGame::giveUp()".
	* Clean up: division of the class (and file) KBBGame in 2 classes (and 2 files) to remove a lot of dependencies to the graphic widget (KBBGraphic) in the main window:
	    - KBBGame: main window of the game
	    - KBBBoard: logical board of the game

1999-06-07  Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@td.org.uit.no>
	* kbbgame.cpp: Changed text Quit to Exit to match KDE style guide.
